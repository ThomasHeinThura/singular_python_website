    Freelance Machine Learning Engineer and Data scientist	(November 2021- Present):  
    - Successfully solved industry-complex data storage, data modeling, 
    and machine learning problems using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

    - Developed a fraud detection classification model for local bank sectors, 
    optimizing accuracy, reducing false positives, and addressing data engineering workload.

    - Implemented an automatic ETL pipeline using AWS services, 
    reducing the data engineering workload by 10% and ensuring real-time data accuracy.

    - Built a Text Summarization website as a personal hobby project, 
    leveraging natural language processing techniques and testing with state-of-the-art models.

    - Utilized oversampling and undersampling techniques to address imbalanced datasets in insurance premium payments 
    and credit card fraud datasets, improving model generalization by 30% and achieving 99% accuracy.

    - Completed various TensorFlow CV and NLP projects, 
    including CIFAR10 classification, sign language classification, GI tract X-ray segmentation, IMDb film rating classifications, 
    Reuters documents with articles classification, sarcasm tweet detection, disaster tweet classification, and BBC articles classification.

    - Developed models for weather temperature detection 
    and energy price detection using time series analysis.

    - Currently working on projects on UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation 
    and brain tumour detection, and ETL automation pipeline in local bank sectors.
